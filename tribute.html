      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Abdollah Alimorad is one of Iran’s most influential masters of puppet animation,
         known for his delicate craftsmanship and poetic visual storytelling. 
         Born in 1948 in Tehran, he studied animation and puppetry in Czechoslovakia, 
         where he refined a unique aesthetic rooted in traditional Iranian art, 
         handcrafted miniatures, and expressive puppet movement.

        Returning to Iran, he became a central figure at IRIB’s Institute for
         the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanoon),
          where he produced some of the most iconic puppet and stop-motion works
           in Iranian cinema. His films are known for their quiet beauty, 
           symbolic imagery, and emotional warmth.

        Alimorad’s animations are not simply stories, they are worlds built by hand,
         where every character carries a soul and every movement feels alive.
